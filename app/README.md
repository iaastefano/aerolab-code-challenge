# Things to keep in mind
- The page is not responsive. It works perfect for 1920x1080 resolutions.
- About code: it is not completely atomized into many components as I would like but for a matter of time they stayed like this.
- The 'balance card' appears to the left and not to the bottom, I know.
- The 'filter by' list is primitive, I couldn't change the style at time.
- The 'sort by' called 'Most Recents' does not work, I don't know by which field to sort.
- Thank you for taking the time to read and understand these points.
